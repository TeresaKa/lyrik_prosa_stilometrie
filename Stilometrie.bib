@article{Stamatatos,
abstract = {Authorship attribution supported by statistical or computational methods has a long history starting from the 19th century and is marked by the seminal study of Mosteller and Wallace (1964) on the authorship of the disputed "Federalist Papers." During the last decade, this scientific field has been developed substantially, taking advantage of research advances in areas such as machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing. The plethora of available electronic texts (e.g., e-mail messages, online forum messages, blogs, source code, etc.) indicates a wide variety of applications of this technology, provided it is able to handle short and noisy text from multiple candidate authors. In this article, a survey of recent advances of the automated approaches to attributing authorship is presented, examining their characteristics for both text representation and text classification. The focus of this survey is on computational requirements and settings rather than on linguistic or literary issues. We also discuss evaluation methodologies and criteria for authorship attribution studies and list open questions that will attract future work in this area.},

@article{Juola2015,
abstract = {We propose a possible solution to one of the major weaknesses in the application of authorship attribution-the absence of clear-cut standards for accurate analytic practice. To address this, we propose a specific practice as a possible standard and present four recent cases applying this standard. The key elements of this protocol are the use of an ad hoc distractor set in conjunction with multiple analyses structured as a set of elimination tests. This protocol (or close variants of it) has been used in at least four separate cases across a wide variety of documents and consumers. It is mathematically supported while still being easy to understand. We are confident that the proposed protocol will provide a relatively straightforward and understandable way to reduce controversy regarding stylometric authorship attribution, and thereby increase its uptake and credibility.},
